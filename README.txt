I. Tools used: 

    - npm (node package manager), automatically installed 
    with NodeJs

II. Core Concepts: 

III. Commits Logs: 

    1. Using configuration file: 
    - Files in 2nd Commit
    
    - $ npm init > release package.json file is a
    configuration file for your project. 

    - Can edit scripts in configuration file. 
    For example, we can type $npm start and 
    project would run the same as command: 
    $ node app.js (1st commit)

    - Note that for any other scripts different than 
    "start", we have to include run. For example: 
    $ npm run start-server > would work
    $ npm start-server > won't work

    (HAVE TO LOOK INTO package.json under "script" to understand)
